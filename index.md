# SSABox Icons

SSABox Icons is an open-source, neutral-style collection of system icons for designers and developers. Unlike our fragmented icon library, all 2500+ icons have been carefully crafted to ensure readability, compatibility, and pixel-perfect genes. Each icon is designed in "Outline" and "Fill" styles based on a 24x24 grid. Of course, all icons are free for personal and commercial use.
